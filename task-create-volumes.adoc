After you set up your working environment, you can create Azure NetApp Files accounts, capacity pools, and volumes.

== Create volumes

You can create NFS or SMB volumes in a new or existing Azure NetApp Files account.

.Before you begin

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory.

* When planning to create an SMB volume, you must have a Windows Active Directory server available to which you can connect. You will enter this information when creating the volume.

.Steps

. Open the Azure NetApp Files working environment.

. Click *Add New Volume*.

. Provide the required information on each page:

* *Azure NetApp Files Account*: Choose an existing Azure NetApp Files account or create a new account. When creating a new account you can also choose the Resource Group that you want to use.

* *Capacity Pool*: Select an existing capacity pool or create a new capacity pool.
+
If you create a new capacity pool, you need to specify a size and select a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[service level^].
+
The minimum size for the capacity pool is 1 TB.

* *Details & Tags*: Enter the volume name and size, the VNet and subnet where the volume should reside, and optionally specify tags for the volume. Choose *Standard* or *Basic* networking. *Standard* supports virtual network (VNet) features while *Basic* has reduced IP limits (<1000) and no additional VNet features for the volume.
+
The following example describes a volume called *demo-s*, does not apply any tags and indicates that the volume will use *Standard* networking, which supports VNet features.
