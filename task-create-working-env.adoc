After you set up a service account, create a Google Cloud NetApp Volumes working environment in BlueXP so you can start managing your Google Cloud NetApp Volumes instances.

Cloud volumes for this subscription are displayed in the working environment. Add new volumes if none exist.

NOTE: If you have subscriptions and volumes in multiple Google Cloud projects, you need to perform this task for each project.

.Before you begin

You must have the following information available when adding a subscription for each project:

* Service account credentials (JSON private key you downloaded)

* Project name

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, select *Add Working Environment* and select *Google Cloud Platform*.

. Next to Google Cloud Netapp Volumes, select *Discover*.

. Provide information about your NetApp Volumes subscription:

.. Enter the working environment name you want to use.
.. Copy/paste the JSON private key you downloaded in the previous steps.
.. Select *Apply credentials*.
.. Select the name of your Google Cloud project.
.. Select the region where you want to create the working environment. The region must be one of the supported regions for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes.
.. Select *Discover*.
